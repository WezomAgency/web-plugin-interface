A simple interface for implementing abstract factories.  
These factories allow you to remove routine work, as well as to simplify the preparation and initialization of most web plug-ins: sliders, carousels, pop-up windows, etc.

Although in JavaScript, interfaces are not yet implemented by means of the syntax of the language, but we can follow the basic principles `Interface ⇒ Abstract ⇒ Factory`.

When creating an abstraction, we must implement all the methods and properties of the interface. Which are initially empty and have no logic and code. 
The basis must be laid in an abstract class and brought to a final and typical concept in the classes of factories.

`WebPluginInterface` has the core methods and properties that are key to working with most web plugins.
